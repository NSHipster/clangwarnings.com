# Clang Warnings

This website aimed to answer the question
"Which Clang Warning Is Generating This Message?"

A few years after this site's launch in June 2014,
the Clang project [added](https://github.com/androm3da/clang-doc/commit/89f2f0d1857f59e6c3625b0aaee69b76a74722cb#diff-b1be48583698a8302bac6ec5266be7ed)
[a comprehensive list of diagnostics](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/DiagnosticsReference.html)
to their documentation,
making this project unnecessary.

Effective December 27, 2018,
the website [clangwarnings.com](https://clangwarnings.com/)
now redirects to the Clang documentation.
